# Feed-Forward-Network

This repository contains an implementation of a simple feed-forward neural network built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The implementation covers every aspect of neural network training, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.

This network was applied on a classification dataset determining whether or not a person has diabetes based off a multitude of factors.
